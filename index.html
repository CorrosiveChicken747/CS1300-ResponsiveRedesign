                I decided to redesign the <a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Berkshire Hathaway Homepage</a>.
                As seen below, the Berkshire Hathaway homepage consists of many links with no overarching structure, with no graphical elements on the page.
                The page is also not responsive, and is not optimized for mobile devices.

                    <ul>
                        <li>There is no hierarchy: Hard to know which links are the most important</li>
                        <li>There are no headers: Hard to know which links are related to eachother</li>
                        <li>There is no defined starting point from which to begin looking at the webpage, leading to confusion</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>This website is hard to <i>learn</i>, because there is nothing to learn/discover. There is no structure to explore.</li>
                        <li>Power users cannot navigate the website more easily, since each link must be read individually to know where it leads</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="vline"></div>

                    <h6>Memorability</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To its credit, the site is easy to memorize if the user only goes to one link regularly -- users just need to remember the location of their link</li>
                        <li>If the website layout changes slightly (i.e. a link is added or removed) this could impact memorability, and could result in users clicking the wrong link</li>
                    </ul>

                <h5 class="centered-text">Accessibility</h5>
                <p class="centered-text">
                    Despite the website's simple text-first structure, the website has several failings for visually-impaired users.
                    Primarily, website text is often very small, leading to difficulty reading the text for those with poor eyesight,
                    and users with scren readers will need to painfully iterate through every single link on the site, since there is no structure.

            <h4 class="centered-text">Lo-Fi Prototyping (Balsamiq)</h4>
            <p class="centered-text">
                I began by creating a lo-fi prototype of the website, using a simple wireframe to create a basic structure for the website.
                The original website was very simple, allowing for a high degree of memorability. I wanted to keep this aspect of the website,
                and as a result all links are still accessible from the top-level of the site, with no submenus.
                I also wanted to improve on the user experience for new users, and as a result I added an 'About Us' section, as well as some visual elements.

            <p> For tablets and smaller rectangular screens, the space between the categories and edge of the screen can be shrunk</p>
            <div class="hline"></div>
            <h6 class="centered-text">Mobile Site:</h6>
            <img class="centered-img-vertical rounded-corners" src="lofi-mobile-bh.png">
            <p>For mobile devices, the categories are stacked vertically, with the 'About Us' and 'Contact Us' sections behind a hamburger menu</p>

        <div id="hifi">
            <h4 class="centered-text">Hi-Fi Prototyping (Figma)</h4>
            <p class="centered-text">
                Transitioning to Hi-Fi design, I had to choose a color scheme for the website. I chose a design that was primarily white,
                to keep the simple and clean look of the website, but added some greys and blues to make the website appear more trustworty,
                complete, and blend in with the blue-highlighted links.

            <img class="centered-img rounded-corners" src="hifi-desktop-bh.png">
            <p> Like the Lo-Fi, tablets and smaller rectangular screens can shrink the space between the categories and edge of the screen</p>

            <h6 class="centered-text">Mobile Site:</h6>

            <p class="centered-text">
                The finished product is a simple, clean, and easy-to-use website. The website is responsive, and can be used on any device.
                The website is also easy to learn, as the user can easily discover the structure of the website, and can easily find the links they need.
                The website is also easy to memorize, as the user can easily remember the location of the links they use regularly.
